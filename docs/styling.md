## Main app design

Set background to be white, with the component to have a Card design (minimal drop-shadow), with three sections:

1. Input JSON
2. Filter / Logstash parsing code
3. Resulting parsed UDM

## Interaction

There should be a single button "Parse" that performs the parsing operation.

## Icons
Use `npm install lucide-react` for icons on the app.
